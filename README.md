Weather Dashboard

This is a simple, user-friendly weather dashboard that provides current weather conditions, an hourly forecast, and a 4-day forecast for any city in the world. The dashboard is designed with a sleek, neumorphic interface that's both modern and easy to read.

How to Use

Automatic Weather Detection: When you first open the dashboard, it will ask for your permission to access your current location. If you allow it, the dashboard will automatically display the weather for your current location.

Search for a City: To find the weather for a specific city, simply type the name of the city into the search bar at the top right of the page and click the "Search" button or press the "Enter" key.

View Weather Details:

The main weather card shows the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., "Broken Clouds"), and the city name.

Below the main card, you'll find an hourly forecast for the next several hours.

Further down, there is a 4-day forecast that shows the expected weather for the upcoming days.
